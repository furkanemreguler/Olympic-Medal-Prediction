## Project Overview

This project analyzes past Olympic results and country metrics (e.g., GDP, population, past performance) to build models that forecast gold, silver, and bronze medal counts for each nation in upcoming Olympic Games.

---

## Data

- `teams.csv`: historical team performance and medal counts
- Additional datasets (e.g., country-level economic indicators) may be merged for feature enrichment.

---

## Requirements

Install the following packages:

```
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Olympic-Medal-Prediction.git
   cd Olympic-Medal-Prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat   # Windows (cmd)
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Open `model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Run each cell sequentially:
   - Load and inspect the data
   - Clean and preprocess features
   - Train and evaluate predictive models
   - Generate forecasts for target Olympic year
3. Export predictions or analysis plots as needed.
